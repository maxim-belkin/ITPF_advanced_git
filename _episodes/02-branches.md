Let's go back to our main story line.
So, we're an employee in a Mega Store in one of its departments and our manager asks us to do two
things:

1. document how much stuff we have left (inventory control), and
2. develop a nice "About Us" page describing our department and why it is so great

We want to do both of these tasks immediately, but we don't want to screw anything up the main
`master` branch (which is continuously monitored by the store owner).
For that purpose we create a new branch in our repository:

~~~
git branch inventory_control
~~~
{: .language-bash}

When we execute this command, nothing changes in our working tree.
However, if we look at at the `.git/refs/heads` folder we'll see a new file there, called
`inventory_control`:

~~~
ls .git/refs/heads/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
inventory_control  master
~~~
{: .output}

Let's compare both files in that directory:

~~~
cat .git/refs/heads/master .git/refs/heads/inventory_control
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
d1fbc13485d81ce536ce6ccd57d80ddd8e2a8a84
d1fbc13485d81ce536ce6ccd57d80ddd8e2a8a84
~~~
{: .output}

Yes, they are identical! And yes, this is all that Git has done when we executed that `git branch`
command -- it created a file in `.git/refs/heads` directory. Let's see how `git log` reports this to
us:

~~~
git log --oneline -1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
d1fbc13 (HEAD -> master, inventory_control) Adding 'Staff' section
~~~
{: .output}

Schematically, this is how it looks like:

![Creating a new branch with `git branch` command](../fig/svgs/git_branch_0.svg)

Note the new "inventory_control" label -- this is our new branch.
What we did here is quite simple: we created a new branch which, at the time of creation, is
identical to the active branch.

However, which branch are we one? In other words, if we create a new commit -- which label will
move?  `master` or `inventory_control`? Or, maybe, both?

In Git, currently checked out branch is pointed out by a special pointer called `HEAD`.
Just like with branches, it uses for this pointer a file called `HEAD` in `.git` directory.
Have a look at it!

~~~
cat .git/HEAD
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
ref: refs/heads/master
~~~
{: .output}

Similarly to the output of `git log`, the content of this file tells us that our `HEAD`
still points to `master`.
It means that if we create a commit now, it will be

* created in the branch `master`, not `inventory_control`, and
* its parent will be the commit at which `HEAD` (and, therefore, `master`) points to.

To switch to the `inventory_control` branch we need to check it out:

~~~
git checkout inventory_control
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Let's see what changes in the output of `git log` after we do that:

~~~
git checkout inventory_control
git log --oneline -1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
d1fbc13 (HEAD -> inventory_control, master) Adding 'Staff' section
~~~
{: .output}

Excellent! We have now switched our `HEAD` to our newly created branch so new commits will be added
to it instead of `master`.


![Switching a branch with `git checkout` command](../fig/svgs/git_branch_1.svg)

{: .callout}

Let's make couple of commits in this branch:
1. Let's create a file called `departments/<department>/inventory.yml` (replace `<department>` with
   the name of the department you've been assigned to) with a few items in it and commit it to the
   repository. This file will list items in our inventory  in the following format:
   ~~~
   item:
     count: <number>
     price: <number>
   ~~~
   {: .code}
2. We'll update this file to include one (or more) items and commit the changes again.
   Please use the department's name assigned to you.

~~~
mkdir -p departments/kids

cat > departments/kids/inventory.yml <<EOS
barbie:
  count: 35
  price: 12.5
pikachu:
  count: 10
  print: 19.99
EOS

git add departments/kids/inventory.yml
git commit -m "Kids department: inventory"

cat >> departments/kids/inventory.yml <<EOS
robot:
  count: 100
  price: 8.99
EOS

git add -u .
git commit -m "Kids department: added  robot"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Now let's check that the right commits have been created in the right branch:

~~~
git log --oneline -3
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
eb9ef42 (HEAD -> inventory_control) Kids department: added  robot
7d6e34d Kids department: inventory
d1fbc13 (master) Adding 'Staff' section
~~~
{: .output}

This output shows that `inventory_control` branch is two commits ahead of `master`.

![Branch `inventory_control` is 2 commits ahead of `master`](../fig/svgs/git_branch_2.svg)

Congratulations! We've created a branch and created a few commits in it. Now, let's switch back to
the `master` and see what happened there.

{: .challenge}

~~~
ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
README.md
~~~
{: .output}

Wow! There is no `departments` folder altogether! But don't worry - we haven't lost any of our work.
When we switched branches with `git checkout`, Git updated our working directory to match the state
at which it was when we started working on `inventory_control` branch.

## More work -- more fun!

Our supervisor approached us and asked to urgently add department's
working hours to a `README.md` file in `departments/kids` directory.

Well, we've done this many times already so please do it on your own.

{: .solution}

**Great job!**


## Merging branches

Now, we're ready to combine our changes we've added in the `inventory_control` branch to the main
`master` branch. In Git, it is as easy as:

~~~
# on branch master
git merge inventory_control
~~~
{: .language-bash}

with the only condition that we have to be on the branch with which we are merging the specified
branch. The above command will open your text editor to specify a commit message. By default, the
message will read:

~~~
Merge branch 'inventory_control'
~~~
{: .code}

Hit <kbd>Return</kbd> and wait a split second for Git to merge the branches.
Now, our Git repository history should look like this:

![Commit layout after `git merge`](../fig/svgs/git_branch_3.svg)

Let's have a look how Git shows such commits in the log.
We will use `git log` command again. However, this time we will specify a new option `--graph`

~~~
git log --oneline --graph -5
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
*   9af2304 (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'inventory_control'
|\
| * eb9ef42 (inventory_control) Kids department: added  robot
| * 7d6e34d Kids department: inventory
* | bac2779 Kids department: adding hours of operation
|/
* d1fbc13 Adding 'Staff' section
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Git shows that the last (top-most) commit in the history (`9af2304`) is connected to two commits:
`eb9ef42` and `bac2779`.

Now, let's look at this commit with `git cat-file`:

~~~
git cat-file -p 9af2304
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Merge branch 'inventory_control'
~~~
{: .output}

Note the two `parent` lines near the top of the provided output.
When a commit has more than one parent, it is called a "merge" commit.
This brings us to the following classification:

In Git, commits may have:

- 0 "parents". These commits are called "orphans"
- 1 "parent". These are normal commits.
- 2+ "parents". These commits are called "merges".

We can list all these types of commits using `--max-parents=` and `--min-parents=` options for
`git log`:

~~~
git log --max-parents=0 --oneline # list 'orphans' (e.g., initial commits)
git log --min-parents=2 --oneline # list 'merges'
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
4685727 Initial commit.
9af2304 (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'inventory_control'
~~~
{: .output}
